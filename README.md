# c_33_readability

## DESCRIPTION

The program calculates the approximate grade level needed to comprehend some text, per the below.

```bash
./readability
Text: Congratulations! Today is your day. You're off to Great Places! You're off and away!
Grade 3
```

### BACKGROUND

According to Scholastic, E.B. White’s Charlotte’s Web is between a second- and fourth-grade reading level, and Lois Lowry’s The Giver is between an eighth- and twelfth-grade reading level. What does it mean, though, for a book to be at a particular reading level?

Well, in many cases, a human expert might read a book and make a decision on the grade (i.e., year in school) for which they think the book is most appropriate. But an algorithm could likely figure that out too!

So what sorts of traits are characteristic of higher reading levels? Well, longer words probably correlate with higher reading levels. Likewise, longer sentences probably correlate with higher reading levels, too.

A number of “readability tests” have been developed over the years that define formulas for computing the reading level of a text. One such readability test is the Coleman-Liau index. The Coleman-Liau index of a text is designed to output that (U.S.) grade level that is needed to understand some text.
The formula is

```c
index = 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8
```

where `L` is the average number of letters per 100 words in the text, and `S` is the average number of sentences per 100 words in the text.

Let’s write a program called `readability` that takes a text and determines its reading level. For example, if user types in a line of text from Dr. Seuss, the program should behave as follows:

```text
./readability
Text: Congratulations! Today is your day. You're off to Great Places! You're off and away!
Grade 3
```

The text the user inputted has 65 letters, 4 sentences, and 14 words. 65 letters per 14 words is an average of about 464.29 letters per 100 words:

`65 / 14 * 100 = 464.29`

And 4 sentences per 14 words is an average of about 28.57 sentences per 100 words:

`4 / 14 * 100 = 28.57`

Plugged into the Coleman-Liau formula, and rounded to the nearest integer, we get an answer of 3:

`0.0588 * 464.29 - 0.296 * 28.57 - 15.8 = 3`

So this passage is at a third-grade reading level.

Let’s try another one:

```text
./readability
Text: Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways. For one thing, he hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year. For another, he really wanted to do his homework, but was forced to do it in secret, in the dead of the night. And he also happened to be a wizard.
Grade 5
```

This text has 214 letters, 4 sentences, and 56 words. That comes out to about 382.14 letters per 100 words, and 7.14 sentences per 100 words. Plugged into the Coleman-Liau formula, we get a fifth-grade reading level.

As the average number of letters and words per sentence increases, the Coleman-Liau index gives the text a higher reading level. If you were to take this paragraph, for instance, which has longer words and sentences than either of the prior two examples, the formula would give the text an twelfth-grade reading level.

```text

### SPECIFICATION

- Your program must prompt the user for a string of text using `get_string`.
- Your program should count the number of letters, words, and sentences in the text. You may assume that a letter is any lowercase character from `a` to `z` or any uppercase character from `A` to `Z`, any sequence of characters separated by spaces should count as a word, and that any occurrence of a period, exclamation point, or question mark indicates the end of a sentence.
- Your program should print as output `Grade X` where `X` is the grade level computed by the Coleman-Liau formula, rounded to the nearest integer.
- If the resulting index number is 16 or higher (equivalent to or greater than a senior undergraduate reading level), your program should output `Grade 16+` instead of giving the exact index number. If the index number is less than 1, your program should output `Before Grade 1`.

### Example sentences

```text
- One fish. Two fish. Red fish. Blue fish. (Before Grade 1)

- Would you like them here or there? I would not like them here or there. I would not like them anywhere. (Grade 2)

- Congratulations! Today is your day. You're off to Great Places! You're off and away! (Grade 3)

- Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways. For one thing, he hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year. For another, he really wanted to do his homework, but was forced to do it in secret, in the dead of the night. And he also happened to be a wizard. (Grade 5)

- In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since. (Grade 7)

- Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, "and what is the use of a book," thought Alice "without pictures or conversation?" (Grade 8)

- When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow. When it healed, and Jem's fears of never being able to play football were assuaged, he was seldom self-conscious about his injury. His left arm was somewhat shorter than his right; when he stood or walked, the back of his hand was at right angles to his body, his thumb parallel to his thigh. (Grade 8)

- There are more things in Heaven and Earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy. (Grade 9)

- It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen. Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions, though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him. (Grade 10)

- A large class of computational problems involve the determination of properties of graphs, digraphs, integers, arrays of integers, finite families of finite sets, boolean formulas and elements of other countable domains. (Grade 16+)

## INSTALL LIBRARIES

The source code uses the cs50 library what you can download [HERE](https://github.com/cs50/libcs50).

To install the cs50 library follow the steps:

1. Open git bash terminal and change the current working directory to `src`:  
   > cd ./libsc50/src

2. Compile the cs50.c source into .o with:
   > gcc -c cs50.c -o cs50.o

3. Make the library archive:  
   > ar rcs libcs50.a cs50.o

4. Copy the `libcs50.a` file into your compiler's `lib` directory

5. Copy the `cs50.h` file into your compiler's `include` directory

## COMPILE AND RUN THE CODE

The code is written in C, the compiler used to generate the exe is: `gcc Rev10, Built by MSYS2 project 12.2.0`

Run the below code in terminal (git bash) to compile the source:

> gcc commandLineArgument.c -lcs50 -o ./build/commandLineArgument

To run the executable run the below code in terminal (git bash):
